# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

The HR Analytics Dashboard project, utilizing Power BI, is centered on analyzing employee attrition within an organization. The 
goal is to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to employee turnover. By harnessing HR data and the capabilities 
of Power BI, the project aims to provide HR professionals with valuable insights, empowering them to make informed decisions 
and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition rates.

# Data Gathering:

Importing raw data .csv file into Power BI & transform to Power Query editor for cleaning and data processing.

# Data Preparation:

To ensure accurate results, we cleaned up the data by addressing missing values and standardizing formats.

Removed empty data: Got rid of rows that didn't have any information.

Removed duplicates: Took out any rows that were exactly the same.

Fixed mistakes: Corrected any spelling errors.

Sorted out types: Made sure each piece of data was in the right format.

Added a new column: Made a new column that says '1' if someone left the company ('yes' for attrition), or '0' if they didn't ('no' for attrition).

# KPIs:

To commence the analysis, I identified several key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for monitoring both employee performance and attrition within
the organization. Using Power BI, I visualized these KPIs with card visualizations. The metrics included employee headcount, attrition count,attrition
rate, average age, average income, and average tenure. These indicators offer a comprehensive view of organizational dynamics, enabling informed
decision-making and strategic planning to optimize workforce management and retention strategies.

# Data Visualizations and Findings:

Various charts and visualizations were used to analyze employee data, yielding the following key insights:

Tree map chart: Revealed that 140 males and 79 females had left the company, with higher attrition among males.

Pie chart: Showed the highest attrition in the Life Sciences field (38%), followed by the Medical Field (27%).

Stacked column chart: Indicated that the 26-35 age group had the highest attrition count of 116.

Matrix table: Highlighted that laboratory technicians had the highest attrition count, followed by sales executives and research scientists.

Funnel chart: Displayed that the highest attrition was in the salary slab up to 5K, below the companyâ€™s average income of 6.5K.

Area chart: Showed attrition peaks after the first year, 10 years, and 5 years with the company.

Stacked bar chart: Identified laboratory technicians with the highest attrition count of 62, followed by sales executives and research scientists.

# Filters:
Department filters were added to the top of the dashboard, enabling users to filter data by selecting specific departments.

# HR Suggestions:
Address Male Attrition: Investigate why more male employees are leaving and take steps to meet their needs.

Retain Life Sciences and Medical Staff: Find out why attrition is high in these fields and implement retention strategies.

Support 26-35 Age Group: Address the concerns of employees in this age group to improve career growth and retention.

# Conclusion:
This HR analytics dashboard provided valuable insights into employee data, aiding better decision-making and enhancing employee satisfaction and retention. 
Addressing employee issues and fostering a positive work environment will improve performance and retention, contributing to the organization's success
and profitability.
