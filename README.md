# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

# Objectives

The HR Analytics Dashboard project, utilizing Power BI, is centered on analyzing employee attrition within an organization. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to employee turnover. By harnessing HR data and the capabilities of Power BI, the project aims to provide HR professionals with valuable insights, empowering them to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to reduce attrition rates.

# Data Gathering:

Importing raw data .csv file into Power BI & transform to Power Query editor for cleaning and data processing.

# Data Cleaning and Processing:

To ensure accurate results, we cleaned up the data by addressing missing values and standardizing formats.

Removed empty data: Got rid of rows that didn't have any information.

Removed duplicates: Took out any rows that were exactly the same.

Fixed mistakes: Corrected any spelling errors.

Sorted out types: Made sure each piece of data was in the right format.

Added a new column: Made a new column that says '1' if someone left the company ('yes' for attrition), or '0' if they didn't ('no' for attrition).

# KPIs:

To commence the analysis, I identified several key performance indicators (KPIs) crucial for monitoring both employee performance and attrition within the organization. Using Power BI, I visualized these KPIs with card visualizations. The metrics included employee headcount, attrition count, attrition rate, average age, average income, and average tenure. These indicators offer a comprehensive view of organizational dynamics, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning to optimize workforce management and retention strategies.
